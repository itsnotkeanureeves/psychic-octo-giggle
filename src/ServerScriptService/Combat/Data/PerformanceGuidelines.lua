COMBAT SYSTEM PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION GUIDELINES
============================================================================

This document outlines the key performance optimization strategies implemented
in the combat system, along with guidelines for maintaining good performance
as the system evolves.

============================================================================
1. SPATIAL QUERY OPTIMIZATION
============================================================================

The TargetSystem uses several optimization techniques for efficient spatial queries:

1.1. Entity Filtering Before Distance Calculation
    - Entities are pre-filtered by teams and other criteria before performing
      expensive distance calculations
    - This reduces the number of entities that need spatial processing

1.2. Flat Plane Detection
    - Target detection ignores Y-axis (height) for distance calculations
    - This simplifies calculations and is generally sufficient for gameplay purposes
    - Use the 2D distance formula: sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2) for better performance

1.3. Early Out Optimization
    - Distance checks exit early if target is clearly outside range
    - Angular checks exit early if target is clearly outside cone angle

1.4. Distance Caching
    - Once distance is calculated for an entity, it's cached for the duration of the query
    - This prevents recalculating distances when applying multiple effects

1.5. Spatial Hash Grid (Future Implementation)
    - For large numbers of entities (50+), consider implementing a spatial hash grid
    - Divides the world into a grid of cells and only checks entities in relevant cells
    - Only implement if benchmarks show it's necessary

============================================================================
2. OBJECT POOLING
============================================================================

Object pooling is essential for avoiding garbage collection stutters:

2.1. Effect Pooling (FeedbackSystem)
    - Visual effects are pooled and reused
    - Pools auto-expand based on demand but cap at reasonable limits
    - Prioritizes most visually important effects when pools are maxed out

2.2. Target List Pooling
    - Target result lists are pooled and reused
    - This avoids allocating new tables for every ability cast

2.3. Parameter Reuse
    - Effect parameters are reused when processing multiple targets
    - Only the target-specific data is updated, base parameters remain the same
    - Uses shallow copies to avoid deep object cloning

2.4. Condition Instance Pooling
    - Condition states are managed through a pool system
    - When conditions expire, their state objects return to the pool
    - This avoids constant allocation/deallocation of condition states

============================================================================
3. EFFICIENT CONDITION PROCESSING
============================================================================

Condition processing is optimized to minimize CPU usage:

3.1. Prioritized Processing
    - Conditions are processed in priority order
    - Critical conditions (stuns, controls) are processed first
    - Visual-only conditions are processed at lower priority

3.2. Tick Rate Management
    - Condition tick rates are staggered to distribute processing
    - Conditions with the same tick rate are offset to avoid processing spikes
    - Global tick rate divider adjusts all conditions based on entity count

3.3. Lazy Evaluation
    - Condition handlers use lazy evaluation when possible
    - Effects are only calculated when needed (e.g., only on damage events)
    - Expiration times are checked just-in-time, not continuously

3.4. Stack Efficiency
    - Stack operations are optimized to minimize state changes
    - Effect scaling with stacks uses multiplication instead of iteration
    - Stack count changes trigger events only when visually significant

============================================================================
4. MEMORY MANAGEMENT
============================================================================

Careful memory management is essential for stable performance:

4.1. State Reuse
    - Entity and ability state is reused rather than recreated
    - Ability state is preserved between executions
    - Entity state is preserved between combat sessions

4.2. Minimal Object Creation
    - Avoid creating new tables inside hot loops
    - Use upvalues and locals rather than table lookups where possible
    - Reuse variables for intermediate calculations

4.3. Event Payload Optimization
    - Event payloads are kept minimal
    - Events use entity IDs rather than full entity objects
    - Client events include only the data needed for visualization

4.4. Reference Lifecycle Management
    - Circular references are explicitly broken when no longer needed
    - Entity reference cleanup happens explicitly when entities are removed
    - All temporary references are nullified after use in long-running processes

============================================================================
5. NETWORK OPTIMIZATION
============================================================================

Network traffic is optimized to minimize bandwidth usage:

5.1. Event Batching
    - Multiple combat events are batched where possible
    - High-frequency events like damage numbers are combined
    - Client updates are batched at 10 frames per second maximum

5.2. Relevance Filtering
    - Combat events are only sent to relevant players
    - Events outside player view distance are not sent
    - Low priority events are filtered based on player distance

5.3. Delta Compression
    - Only state changes are sent, not full state
    - Condition updates send only changed stacks/duration
    - Stat updates send only modified stats, not full stat blocks

5.4. Priority Based Synchronization
    - Critical state changes get immediate synchronization
    - Visual-only effects use lower priority synchronization
    - Background processes use lowest priority

============================================================================
6. CONCURRENCY AND THREADING
============================================================================

When applicable, work is distributed to maintain consistent frame rates:

6.1. Deferred Processing
    - Non-critical calculations are deferred to off-peak times
    - Visual feedback processing runs after gameplay processing
    - Long-running calculations are broken into smaller chunks

6.2. Task Scheduling
    - Task.defer() is used for non-immediate operations
    - Task priority ensures critical gameplay tasks complete first
    - Task cancellation prevents wasted processing for defunct entities

6.3. Parallelization (Advanced)
    - Consider actor model for heavy parallel processing if needed
    - Keep combat logic on main thread for consistency
    - Use separate threads only for isolated calculations

============================================================================
7. PERFORMANCE MONITORING
============================================================================

Ongoing performance monitoring ensures the system maintains high performance:

7.1. Internal Benchmarking
    - Key systems have built-in timing diagnostics
    - Running averages track performance trends
    - Anomaly detection flags unexpected performance changes

7.2. Memory Usage Tracking
    - Entity count and memory usage correlation is monitored
    - Pool expansion/contraction is logged for analysis
    - Entity cleanup verification ensures proper garbage collection

7.3. Auto-Scaling
    - Effect quality auto-scales based on client performance
    - Particle count and complexity adjusts dynamically
    - Tick rates adjust based on server load

============================================================================
8. TUNABLE PARAMETERS
============================================================================

Several tunable parameters allow for performance adjustment:

8.1. Effect Density
    - MAX_CONCURRENT_EFFECTS = 20 (maximum simultaneous visual effects)
    - EFFECT_PRIORITY_LEVELS = { CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW }
    - MINIMUM_EFFECT_DISTANCE = 50 (studs away effects start to be culled)

8.2. Condition Processing
    - MAX_CONDITIONS_PER_ENTITY = 25 (soft limit on conditions per entity)
    - CONDITION_TICK_DIVIDER = 1.0 (global tick rate modifier)
    - CONDITION_UPDATE_FREQUENCY = 0.5 (seconds between client updates)

8.3. Target System
    - MAX_TARGETS_PER_ABILITY = 25 (hard cap on targets per ability)
    - TARGET_SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL = 2 (1-3, higher is more optimized)
    - MAX_TARGET_DISTANCE = 100 (maximum targeting distance in studs)

These parameters can be adjusted based on game requirements and performance testing.
